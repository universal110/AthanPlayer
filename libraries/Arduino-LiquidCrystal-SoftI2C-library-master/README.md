# LiquidCrystal_SoftI2C #
This is a fork of the original LiquidCrystal_I2C Library and it works with the [SoftwareWire Library](https://github.com/Testato/SoftwareWire),
instead of hardware I2C.

# Installation #
Create a new folder called "LiquidCrystal_SoftI2C" under the folder named "libraries" in your Arduino sketchbook folder.
Create the folder "libraries" in case it does not exist yet. Place all the files in the "LiquidCrystal_SoftI2C" folder.

SoftwareWire can be installed from the Arduino IDE Library Managers

# Usage #
To use the library in your own sketch, select it from *Sketch > Import Library*.
